# Food Menu Simulator

A small group project that focused on writing modular, well-commented, organized, and industry level code that has been tested using JUnity testing methods.

This program is designed to use a GUI interface to simulate a food ordering system. The features of this program are listed:
- Ability to view, interact, and switch between 2 GUI interfaces : 
  * First menu is to order the food
  * Second menu is to check out your order
- Add any of the standard sandwiches to your order
- Create a custom sandwich : 
  * Bread
  * Meat
  * Additional toppings
  * Sauces and dressings
- View the current list of orders
- Add, duplicate, or remove a sandwich from the order
- Output the list to text files
- Ability to check out the order
- Reset the program

The project was coded in the Java language using both the IntelliJ and Eclipse IDEs. All major classes, functions, and methods are commented to describe their inputs, outputs, functionality, and which partner worked on the said block of code. Extensive testing was performed on the major classes used in the program with JUnit testing and some of our final JUnit testing classes have been kept inside of the source folder.

As per the requirements, we have created a UML diagram that can be found in the project documentation folder.

This project was created by Pujan Patel and Martin Colucci for Rutgers CS213 in Fall 2020
